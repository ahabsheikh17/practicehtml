<h2>Mazar-e-Quaid-e-Azam</h2>

<p>
  Mazar-e-Quaid (Urdu: مزارِ قائد), also known as Jinnah Mausoleum or the
  National Mausoleum, is the final resting place of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the
  founder of Pakistan. Designed in a 1960s modernist style, it was completed
  in 1971, and is an iconic symbol of Karachi as well as one of the most
  popular tourist sites in the city.[1] The mausoleum complex also contains
  the tomb of Jinnah's sister, Māder-e Millat ("Mother of the Nation")
  Fatima Jinnah, as well as those of Liaquat Ali Khan and Nurul Amin, the
  first and eighth Prime Ministers of Pakistan respectively. The tomb of
  Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar, a stalwart of the Muslim League from Peshawar,
  is also located there.
